# nlp
this repo is about natural language processing experiments

It was done while following the excellent Udemy course from 
Jose Portilla [NLP - Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/nlp-natural-language-processing-with-python/).

The repo contains my experiments on the NLP topic.
I tested [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for various nlp oriented tasks.

Typically, I tried Named Entity Recognition or NER on French 
books available at the [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
